# Linear Data Structures

Data structures help us organize, manage and storage information.

A linear data structure has its data elements arranged as a sequence.

## Nodes

Nodes are the building blocks of many computer science data
structures.

A node has:

* Data
* Link to other nodes

In a linear data structure, each node can have only one link connecting it to
the next node

[node.py](https://github.com/nataliabu/linear_data_structures/blob/main/node.py) is my implementation of nodes using python
