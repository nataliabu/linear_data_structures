# Linear Data Structures

Data structures are our friends! They help us organize, manage and storage
information.

A linear data structure has its data elements arranged as a sequence.

## Nodes

Nodes are the building blocks of many computer science data
structures.

A node has:

* Data
* Link(s) to other nodes

Since linear data structures are arranged as a sequence, each node can have only
one link connecting it to the next node (and optionally one link connecting it to 
the previous node).

[node.py](https://github.com/nataliabu/linear_data_structures/blob/main/node.py) is my implementation of nodes using python

## Linked Lists

A linked list is a linear data structure. Contrary to arrays, the elements of a
linked list are not stored in the memory in a contiguous location. Instead the
elements are linked using pointers.

This is very cool because it allows us to add, remove and re-order items easily.
